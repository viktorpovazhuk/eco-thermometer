1. try fram app +
2. what is lpm4.5 +
3. read part about interrupts +
4. find designs for entering lpm -> try
5. ask

----------------------------------
1. read about adc
2. change voltage
3. read value from adc -> understand how functions work +
4. can't get printf work -> uart -> don't use simple things that you would rewrite later!!!
5. find clock src in ds - read freq -> calc params
configure clk to freq -> use driverlib -> read docs - tutorial -> use initial f = 1MHz for DCO, read in guide later +
check adress +
connect USCI0 to usb


6. found example in folder










.....................................................
1. add wire.h -> can't just join
2. find good library and guide for it for msp430fr
3. check msp430 library (build just with lib) +
4. find example in resource explorer +
5. find driver lib user guide +
6. find an example of use +
7. VS Code - connect somehow, later - incapsulate in CCS (if sth goes wrong): no CCS now - move on levels of complexity down in VS Code

8. debug function
9. turn on debug mode in lib +
10. read in ds how to read data
11. try to find realization +

12. use ctpl
13. read new user guide +






-----------------------
1. find datasheet
2. connect to arduino -> in tutorial - special library +
2.1 remind spi theory + -> read i2c theory +
2.2 google msp430 spi -> don't try to find sth fast ! -> read basics article -> guide or youtube
-> parts from guide: clock + youtube: combining
-> ask +
3. fix library error +


------------------------
4. find another lib +
5. work on fram -> read guide for lib

6. build lib








------------------------
1. run in /home/vityha/ti/ccs1100/ccs/install_scripts/install_drivers.sh
2. connect temperature sensor

3. create presentation +
4. watch 1 ex of intro +
5. create repo +

6. find videos +

7. read workshop

8. find instruction for 1 connection +
--------------------------
9. which port to led? -> table isn't in datasheet, but for mcu pinout i have a picture in Hardware Features
nevertheless, word 'led P1.0' I can see on board only

10. read chapter to end +
11. find guide to connect sensor -> use ready library -> check if I know enough -> don't know +

12. or understand that -> don't know many things -> try to find another guide with GOOD DESCRIPTION (images and commented code) -> ask mentor -> wait +

--------------------------------------
1. find driverlib: /home/vityha/ti/msp430ware_3_80_14_01/driverlib
2. try to connect +
3. go to VS Code +

4. try to blink
5. connect sensor
6. select pin ? -> datasheet -_-
7. investigate libs +
8. write my own code to connect -> find example in lib examples
9. set pin in IN mode and UNLOCK -> load driverlib in project -> try another lib
--------------------------------------
1. reread workshop + -> insert Arduino.h in ccs -> include OneWire.h + - check if it is read (later)
2. connect signal analyzer -> read digital input ?
2.2 need to send some signal ? -> try to analyze pin
3. how analogWrite work +
4. try to debug
